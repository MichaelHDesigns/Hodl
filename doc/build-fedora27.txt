The following are the steps i did on fedora 27 to compile the wallet:

yum -y install automake autoconf gcc-c++ protobuf-devel qrencode-devel libevent-devel
yum -y install libdb4-devel libdb4-cxx-devel qt5-devel miniupnpc-devel
yum -y install boost-devel libtool 
yum -y install compat-openssl0-devel.x86_64      <--- Very important !!! otherwise you get configure error libressl
Note: Do not use the built in SSL library, v1.1.x is not supported.

git clone https://github.com/HodlCash/HodlCash.git
cd HodlCash
./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-tests=no --enable-cxx --with-tls
make -j2 

You should have a working wallet with gui at this point.
