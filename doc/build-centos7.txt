The following instructions are for building the HodlCash core only.
Building the wallet currently does not work on CentOS 7.


first checkout the development branch
git clone -b development https://github.com/HodlCash/HodlCash.git HODLDEV
cd HODLDEV

# Install pre-requirements
yum -y install automake autoconf gcc-c++ 
yum -y install epel-release openssl-devel boost-devel libdb4-devel libdb-cxx-devel protobuf-devel qrencode-devel libevent-devel

./autogen.sh
./configure --without-gui --disable-wallet --enable-tests=no

# double check to see if there are no errors otherwise you missed a library

./make ( you can use -j2 if you have 2 cores or -j4 if you have 4cores available to speed up )

# Create your first HodlCash.conf file in ~/.HodlCash/ folder , here is an example:

rpcuser=john
rpcpassword=123
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
server=1
daemon=1
gen=0
minermemory=1
genproclimit=1
listen=0  # Note this is required on CentOS 7 
debug=all
testnet=0

At this point you should be able to call HodlCashd and use HodlCash-cli with it.
You will need to tell the firewall to allow port 3377
firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=3377/tcp
firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=3377/udp

tip: you may need to disable SELINUX
